# Characterizing documents differentially and psychometrically

The fundamental goal of this 1-year research project is to develop a simple recipe for the situation where a scholar has a collection of documents grouped according to a dimension like time, geography, or theme (the "differential" part) and would like to explore what they reveal about those who produced them (the "psychometric" part).  Often there is already some expectation or focus on what will be revealed: for example, the scholars may suspect that documents from sunny climates will reflect a happier population.

# Data summaries

The notion of a "document" varies greatly between studies: some focus on social media, where a document may be a tweet, while others consider novels or volumes of historical records.
